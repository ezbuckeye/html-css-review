## HTML Notes

### Dec 19 2022

**1.** <strong> and <b> are both used to make texts bold. However, <strong> label is more recommended since it has its semantics.

**2.** <em> and <i> are both used to make texts italics. However, <em> label, which stands for emphasize, is more recommended.

**3.** We could add target="\_blank" as an attribute-value pair inside the <a> label so that the link would be opened in new tab.

**4.** <header>(header of the html doc/smaller units), <nav>(for navigation links), <article>, <footer>(e.g., copyright) are container labels for structuring html documents. They would be helpful for semantics HTML as well as CSS styling.

**5.** useful VScode extension: auto rename tag(automatically change the closing tags when the openning tags were changed), prettier(formatter), color hightlight(for css), image preview(<img>), live server
